* Enable debug logging
  Add  --cfg debug to rustc
  export RUST_LOG=::help  to show list of crates
  export RUST_LOG=crate_name,crate_name2,crate_name3
  export RUST_LOG=rustymem
  export RUST_LOG=rustymemcache
  export RUST_LOG=client_test,rustymem

* Tips
** Read mut byte[], turn it into immut byte[], and pass it to ARC
	1) create a new ~[u8] and give it a mutable binding
	2) pass it to read
	3) freeze it by rebinding it immutably
	4) give it to the ARC
** Rust object serialization
   Use extra:serialize module.  extra:serialize is just the interface.  Use the two implementations in extra::ebml or json.
** Timeout in task call.
   In general, have the task create a timer and then select on the timer and whatever you want to have a timeout.
   If the timer finishes first, then you'll unblock (and see it was the timer that finished => ergo timeout).
